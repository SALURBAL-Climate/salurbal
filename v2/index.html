            <p>Salud Urbana en América Latina (<a href="https://drexel.edu/lac/salurbal/overview/" target="_blank">SALURBAL</a>), is a five-year project launched in April 2017. The Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health and partners throughout Latin America and in the United States are working together to study how urban environments and urban policies impact the health of city residents throughout Latin America.</p>

            <h3>How to quantify the contributions of city-level Built Environment (BE) factors to differences in levels of health and health inequalities within and between cities?</h3>

            <br />

            <small>The <b>BE</b> significantly affects the public’s health. For more than a decade there has been an increase in the collaborations among public health, social sciences and urban planning researchers to study how the BE may impact health and health inequities. Several features of Latin American cities (<b>LAC</b>) make them uniquely suited for the study of their urban environment. One approach to managing the complexity and volume of the data describing the urban settings and environmental characteristics of <b>LAC</b> is to develop <b>BE</b> profiles for <b>cities</b> and <b>sub-cities</b>. These profiles are helpful because they help to understand how multiple dimensions of the <b>BE</b> come together in like <b>cities</b>.</small>

            <br /><br />

            <small><b>Sub-cities</b> are derived from the administrative boundary of the respective city.</small>

          </section>
          
          <section>
            
            <p>Analytical process for building the profiles was developed in two domains: <b>Urban Landscape</b> and <b>Street Design</b>.</p>

            <br />

            <!--<small><b>Street Design</b> characterize the shape and connectivity of the city network. To determine the typologies in this domain we selected variables in three subdomains: street density, intersection density and setter network length and structure. The street density subdomain measure the number of streets in the network using the street density variable. The intersection density subdomain measure the number of intersection in the network using the intersection density variable. The street network length and structure measure the directness and length of the streets using the circuity average and street length average variables.</small>-->
            <small><b>Urban Landscape</b> characterizes the distribution of the urban patches. A patch is an area of uninterrupted urban development. To determine the profile in this domain we selected variables in three subdomains: fragmentation, shape and isolation. The fragmentation subdomain measures the division of the patches among the urban extent boundary and was quantified using the following variables: number of patches, patch density, area-weighted mean patch size and effective mesh size. The shape subdomain measures the average shape of the aggregated patches in the urban extent and was quantified using the area-weighted mean shape index variable. The isolation subdomain measures the average distance between urban patches and was quantified using the area-weighted mean nearest neighbor variable.</small>

            <br /><br />

            <!--<p>Variables selected are: <b>Street Density</b>, <b>Intersection Density</b>,  <b>Street Length Average</b>, <b>Circuity Average</b>, <b>Streets per Node Average</b>.</p>-->
            <small>Variables selected are: <b>Area-Weigthed Mean Shape Index</b>, <b>Effective Mesh Size</b>, <b>Area-Weigthed Mean Nearest Neighbor</b>, <b>Patch Density</b>, <b>Number of Urban Patches</b>, <b>Area-Weighted Mean Patch Size</b>.</small>

            <p>The map presents the 1.351 <b>sub-cities</b> for the 10 selected Latin America countries.</p> 

            <br />

            <small>The points represent the <b>sub-cities</b> geolocated with an approximation from its centroid. The upper right table presents the number of <b>sub-cities</b> by country. You can highlight the country of your interest.</small>

            <br /><br />

            <small>&#x1f4a1; Mexico and Brasil are the countries with the highest number of selected sub-cities.</small>

            <p>This boxplot presents the distribution of the <b>Number of Urban Patches</b> (y-axis) by country (x-axis).</p>

            <br />

            <!--<small><b>Intersection Density</b> measures the amount of intersections per km2 of area.</small>-->
            <small>The <b>Number of Urban Patches</b> variable measures the contiguous areas of urban development (urban patches hereafter).</small>

            <br /><br />

            <small>&#x1f4a1; Argentina is the country with the highest variability ranging from 46,25 (quartile 25%) and 268,5 (quartile 75%) indicating a high presence of cities with small and large urban development size. Brasil is the country with the highest number of urban patches with a value upper than 3.000 located in Brasilia. Peru is the country with the lowest variability from the selected countries.</small>

            <p>As in the previous chart, here is presented the distribution of the <b>Area-Weighted Mean Shape Index</b> (y-axis) by country (x-axis).</p>

            <br />

            <!--<small><b>Street length average</b> measures the length of streets in the street network.</small>-->
            <small>The <b>Area-Weighted Mean Shape Index</b> variable is a ratio of the actual perimeter of a patch to the minimum perimeter possible for a maximally compact patch with the same size. The <b>Area-Weighted Mean Shape Index</b> is the weighted average of the shape index for each patch within the geographic boundary. This index is weighted by the area of each patch.</small>
            
            <br /><br />

            <small>&#x1f4a1; Guatemala, Chile, Brasil and Argentina present a high variability in this variable indicating the presence of cities with different shape ranging from compact cities (lower values) to complex cities (higher values).</small>

            <p>Based on the variables previously mentioned, 6 <b>Urban Landscape</b> profiles are identified applying clustering algorithms. As showed in left chart, the profiles are identified by different color hues.</p>

            <br />

            <small>At this point you are able to come back to a previous slide keeping the color hue encoding for the profiles.</small>

            <br /><br />

            <!--<small>Approximately 23% of the cities were identified in the <b style="color: #2ca02c;">typology 2</b> and were the biggest profile. Profile 3 has the lowest presence in the countries (11%). The 66% of cities were assigned to the other. The presence of all profiles were in average similar in terms of prominent presence by country.</small>-->
            <small>&#x1f4a1; Approximately 26% of the <b>sub-cities</b> were identified in the <b style="color: rgb(188, 189, 34);">profile 5</b>, being this the typology with the highest proportion of <b>sub-cities</b> in 50% of the countries. This pattern indicates a tendency of countries to design <b>cities</b> in similar way. The <b style="color: #7f7f7f;">profile 6</b> has the lowest number of identified <b>sub-cities</b>. The 70% of non-indetified <b>sub-cities</b> were assigned to the other typologies. The <b style="color: #ff7f0e;">profile 1</b>, <b style="color: #2ca02c;">profile 2</b> and <b style="color: rgb(227, 119, 194);">profile 4</b> are prominent in similar proportion in countries.</small>

            <p>To identify the contribution of each variable to the identified profiles, a <a href="./scatterplotmatrix.html" target="_blank">scatter plot matrix</a> shows the 6 variables in the y and x-axis. As described in previous slide, color hue is used to represent the assigned profile. <b>Sub-cities</b> can be selected by a drag selection or by country.</p>

          <section>
            
            <p>These profiles can be analyzed in terms of exogenous variables to identify associations with the profiles. The <b>sub-cities</b> are shown for each exogenous variable (x-axis) and for each profile color (y-axis and color hue). <b>Sub-cities</b> can be selected by a drag selection or by country.</p>
